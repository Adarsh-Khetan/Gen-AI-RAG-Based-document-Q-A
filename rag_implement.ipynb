Collections  Interview QuestionsOOPs Concepts in JavaLast Updated : 3 Jan 2026Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that provides concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.Simula\\xa0is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a pure object-oriented programming language.Smalltalk\\xa0is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.The popular object-oriented languages are\\xa0Java,\\xa0C#,\\xa0PHP,\\xa0Python,\\xa0C++, etc.OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities, for example, objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.Object\\xa0means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.\\xa0Object-oriented programming\\xa0is a methodology or paradigm for designing a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:ObjectClassInheritancePolymorphismAbstractionEncapsulationApart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:CouplingCohesionAssociationAggregationCompositionObjectAny entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. It contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other\\'s data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.To read more Object in JavaExample: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.The primary elements of an object are:State: It is embodied in an object\\'s properties. Additionally, it reflects an object\\'s attributes.Behavior: An object\\'s methods are a representation of it. Additionally, it represents how an object reacts to other objects.Identity: Identity is a special name that gives a thing the ability to communicate with other objects.Method: A method is a group of statements that carry out a certain operation and give an outcome. A method can complete a certain task without giving back any results. Methods are regarded as time savers since they enable us to reuse the code without having to type it again. Java differs from languages like C, C++, and Python in that each method needs to be a component of a class.Example of ObjectExampleclass Dog {\\r\\n    String name;\\r\\n    void bark() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(name + \" says Woof!\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\npublic class Main {\\r\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n        Dog myDog = new Dog();     // Creating an object\\r\\n        myDog.name = \"Rocky\";      // Assigning value to the object\\'s field\\r\\n        myDog.bark();              // Calling method on the object\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\nCompile and RunOutput:\\r\\nRocky says Woof!ClassClass is a logical entity. A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which we can create an individual object. Class does not consume any space.In general, a class declaration includes the following in the order as it appears:Modifiers:\\xa0A class can be public or have default access.class keyword:\\xa0The class keyword is used to create a class.Class name:\\xa0The name must begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).Superclass (if any):\\xa0The name of the class\\'s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.Interfaces (if any):\\xa0A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.Body:\\xa0The class body surrounded by braces, { }.To read more Class Definition in JavaInheritanceWhen one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.To read more Inheritance in JavaExample of InheritanceExample// Superclass (Parent)\\r\\nclass Vehicle {\\r\\n    void start() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle is starting...\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    void stop() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle is stopping...\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n// Subclass (Child) - Inherits from Vehicle\\r\\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\\r\\n    void honk() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Car is honking!\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\npublic class MainExample {\\r\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n        Car myCar = new Car();\\r\\n        // Calling inherited methods (from Vehicle)\\r\\n        myCar.start();\\r\\n        myCar.stop();\\r\\n        // Calling child class method\\r\\n        myCar.honk();\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\nCompile and RunOutput:\\r\\nVehicle is starting...\\r\\nVehicle is stopping...\\r\\nCar is honking!\\r\\nPolymorphismIf\\xa0one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example, to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, a shape, a triangle, a rectangle, etc.To read more Polymorphism in JavaIn Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat says meow, a dog barks woof, etc.Example of PolymorphismExampleclass Animal {\\r\\n    // Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism)\\r\\n    void sound() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"An animal makes a sound\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    void sound(String type) {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Animal sound: \" + type);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\nclass Dog extends Animal {\\r\\n    // Method Overriding (runtime polymorphism)\\r\\n    @Override\\r\\n    void sound(String type) {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Dog barking is: \" + type);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\npublic class Main {\\r\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n        Animal a = new Animal();\\r\\n        Dog d = new Dog();\\r\\n        Animal poly = new Dog(); \\r\\n        // Method Overloading\\r\\n        a.sound();\\r\\n        a.sound(\"Generic\");\\r\\n        // Method Overriding\\r\\n        d.sound(\"Loud\");\\r\\n        // Performing the Polymorphism \\r\\n        poly.sound(\"Soft\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\nCompile and RunOutput:\\r\\nAn animal makes a sound\\r\\nAnimal sound: Generic\\r\\nDog barking is: Loud\\r\\nDog barking is: Soft\\r\\nAbstractionHiding internal implementation and showing functionality only to the user is known as abstraction. For example, in phone calls, we do not know the internal processing. In Java, we use abstract classes and interfaces to achieve abstraction.To read more Abstraction in JavaExample of AbstractionExampleabstract class Animal {\\r\\n    abstract void makeSound();\\r\\n    // Creating a Concrete method \\r\\n    void breathe() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Animal is breathing...\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n// Concrete subclass\\r\\nclass Dog extends Animal {\\r\\n    // implementation for an abstract method\\r\\n    @Override\\r\\n    void makeSound() {\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Dog barking\");\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\npublic class Main {\\r\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n        Animal myDog = new Dog();\\r\\n        myDog.breathe();\\r\\n        myDog.makeSound();\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\nCompile and RunOutput:\\r\\nAnimal is breathing...\\r\\nDog barking\\r\\nEncapsulationBinding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule is wrapped with different medicines.A Java class is an example of encapsulation. A Java bean is a fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private.To read more Encapsulation in JavaExample of AbstractionExampleclass Student {\\r\\n    // Private data members\\r\\n    private String name;\\r\\n    // Setter method\\r\\n    public void setName(String name) {\\r\\n        this.name = name;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    // Getter method\\r\\n    public String getName() {\\r\\n        return name;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\npublic class Main {\\r\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\r\\n        Student s = new Student();\\r\\n        // Setting value using setter\\r\\n        s.setName(\"John\");\\r\\n        // Getting value using getter\\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Student Name: \" + s.getName());\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\nCompile and RunOutput:\\r\\nStudent Name: JohnCouplingCoupling refers to the knowledge, information, or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has information about another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. We can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.To read more Loose Coupling in JavaCohesionCohesion refers to the level of a component that performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is highly cohesive because it has I/O related classes and interfaces. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.To read more Cohesion in JavaAssociationThe association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:One-to-OneOne to ManyMany to OneMany-to-ManyFor example, a country can have one prime minister (one-to-one), and a prime minister can have many ministers (one-to-many). Also, many MPs can have one prime minister (many to one), and many ministers can have many departments (many to many).Note: The association can be unidirectional or bidirectional.To read more Association in JavaAggregationAggregation is a way to achieve Association. It represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects. It is also termed as a\\xa0HAS-A\\xa0relationship in Java. Like, inheritance represents the\\xa0IS-A relationship. It is another way to reuse objects.To read more Aggregation in JavaCompositionThe composition is also a way to achieve Association. The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object. It is the state where objects do not have an independent existence. If we delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically.To read more Composition in JavaAdvantages of OOP Over Procedure-Oriented Programming LanguageOOPs make development and maintenance easier, whereas in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if the code grows as the project size increases.OOP provides data hiding, whereas in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.OOPs provide the ability to simulate real-world events much more effectively. We can provide the solution to real-world problems if we use an Object-Oriented Programming language.What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and an object-based programming language?Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOP except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are the best examples of object-based programming languages.Example// Java program for demonstrating the features and functionalities of OOP concepts in Java.  \\r\\nclass Animal {  \\r\\n    private String name;  \\r\\n    // Constructor  \\r\\n    public Animal(String name) {  \\r\\n        this.name = name;  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n    // Encapsulation: Getter method  \\r\\n    public String getName() {  \\r\\n        return name;  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n    // Polymorphism: Overridden method  \\r\\n    public void makeSound() {  \\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Some sound\");  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n}  \\r\\n// Derived class (Inheritance)  \\r\\nclass Dog extends Animal {  \\r\\n    // Constructor  \\r\\n    public Dog(String name) {  \\r\\n        super(name);  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n    // Polymorphism: Overriding method  \\r\\n    @Override  \\r\\n    public void makeSound() {  \\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Woof\");  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n}  \\r\\n// Derived class (Inheritance)  \\r\\nclass Cat extends Animal {  \\r\\n    // Constructor  \\r\\n    public Cat(String name) {  \\r\\n        super(name);  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n    // Polymorphism: Overriding method  \\r\\n    @Override  \\r\\n    public void makeSound() {  \\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Meow\");  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n}  \\r\\npublic class Main{  \\r\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {  \\r\\n        // Creating objects of the Dog and Cat classes  \\r\\n        Dog dog = new Dog(\"Buddy\");  \\r\\n        Cat cat = new Cat(\"Whiskers\");  \\r\\n        // Accessing methods of the base class through objects of derived classes  \\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Dog name: \" + dog.getName());  \\r\\n        dog.makeSound();  \\r\\n        System.out.println(\"Cat name: \" + cat.getName());  \\r\\n        cat.makeSound();  \\r\\n    }  \\r\\n}  \\r\\nCompile and RunOutput:\\r\\nDog name: Buddy\\r\\nWoof\\r\\nCat name: Whiskers\\r\\nMeow\\r\\nNext TopicNaming Convention in Java\\xa0← prev next →\\xa0Related Poststhis Keyword in JavaJava Classes and Objectsstatic keyword in JavaJava Naming ConventionConstructors in JavaMethods in JavaSubscribe to Tpoint TechWe request you to subscribe our newsletter for upcoming updates.

      " Based on the context provided, I will attempt to explain multi-head attention in Transformers in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-head attention is a key component of the Transformer model, which allows it to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions within an input sequence. This process enables the model to capture complex relationships between different parts of the input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand multi-head attention, let's break down its components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Query (Q)**: The query is a vector that represents the input data. In the context of Transformers, this can be thought of as the \"what\" or \"question\" being asked about the input sequence.\n",
      "2. **Key (K)**: The key is a vector that represents the input data. Similar to the query, the key can be seen as the \"what\" or \"information\" being represented by the input sequence.\n",
      "3. **Value (V)**: The value is another vector that represents the input data. Again, this can be thought of as the \"why\" or \"reason\" behind the input sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multi-head attention mechanism involves concatenating the output of multiple attention heads and then applying a linear transformation to the resulting vector. This process allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions within the input sequence.\n",

      "In more detail, the formula for multi-head attention is:\n",
      "\n",
      "`MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head1,..., headh)WO`\n",
      "\n",
      "where `headi = Attention(QWQ,i,WK,ki, VWV)` represents a single attention head. This head takes the query (`QWQ`), key (`WK`), and value (`VWV`) vectors as input and produces a weighted sum of these vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weights are parameter matrices `WQ`, `WK`, and `WV` that are learned during training. These weights determine how much each representation subspace is attended to at different positions in the input sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By concatenating the output of multiple attention heads, the Transformer model can jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, allowing it to capture complex relationships between different parts of the input data.\n",

      "In summary, multi-head attention in Transformers allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions within an input sequence. This process enables the model to capture complex relationships between different parts of the input data and is a key component of the Transformer's ability to understand and generate human language.\n",
